Выясните источник этих пожеланий, кто рекомендовал (район, улицу, дом). Выясните почему для клиента так важен статус жилья. Клиент значительно стеснен в финансовых условиях. Скорее он будет склонен к изменению района и статуса жилья, чем пойдет на увеличение цены. Поэтому можно варьировать и предлагать другие районы. Основная задача Бытовая. Скорее всего клиент на зря выбрал указанные район. Уточните все параметры. Уточните источники потребности. Семья и родственники играют главную роль.\n        </ConclusionContent>\n        <ConclusionTitle>Обратите внимание</ConclusionTitle>\n        <ConclusionContent>\n          Контакт не дает объективную картину, либо не является источником потребности. Ищите правдивую информацию проводя более качественное интервью или ищите чью потребность он озвучивает мотивируйте тем, что умеете подбирать выгодные варианты с учетом всех требований клиентов. Скажите, что в моей работе мелочей не бывает, поэтому я готов учесть все детали. Если клиент не меняет условия качества жилья и не снижает требования к району, сделка скорее всего не состоится. Упирайте на красивой и спокойное решение бытовых проблем. Скажите, что умеете очень эффективно учитывать требования клиента к обустройству семьи на новом месте. Отметьте, что семейные ценности вам близки и понятны.\n        </ConclusionContent>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProfileConclusion\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n//
